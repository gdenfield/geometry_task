function CR=xstep(Cum)%XSTEP creates two-column array for plotting cumulative record when x increment always 1% Syntax is CR=xstep(Cum)% Cum is a vector of cumulative response counts or measures over a sequence of trials% The entry in the nth row of Cum is the total count or measure as of end of nth trialN=(1:length(Cum))'; % Trial-count vectorCumd=sort(repmat(Cum,2,1));% makes doublet vector, which has two successive identical values for each single value of CumNd=sort(repmat(N,2,1)); % doublet vector for trial countsNd=[0;Nd]; %0th trial is trial before observation begins; origin of x axisCumd=[0;0;Cumd(1:end-1)]; % There are 0 (observed) responses as of 0th trial% and also at beginning of 1st trial. Cum(1) gives count as of end of 1st trial.% Doublet of final cumulation is droppedCR=[Nd Cumd]; % Data required to make a step-plot cumulative record% with trials (Nd) on x axis and cumulation (Cumd) on y axis
