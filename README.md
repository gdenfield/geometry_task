# geometry_task
Files for geometry task. Below is a brief overview of the organization and contents of this repository. More specific documentation can be found in each of the subfolders.

## Folder Organization

- Over the course of training, I've created two substantially different versions of the task. **geometry_v2** is close to the task we've discussed in project proposals, but **geometry_v1** might come in handy for training new animals (due to greater control over the number of stimuli and the contrast of targets, which can be adjusted in real-time while the animal trains).

- **Fractals** contains many fractals I've generated, as well as the python code to generate new stimuli. I have gotten in the habit of taking new fractals out of the unused pool, and moving copies of the old fractals (with filenames unchanged) into the **used_stimuli** folder.

- **Grants** contains matrials I prepared for grant submissions.
  - The **NRSA** folder contains Microsoft Word and PDF files of my F31 submission in Dec. 2020, reviewer comments to that submission, and the resubmission from Dec. 2021. There is also a file **behavior_figures.m** that contains the analyses and scripts to generate figures for the 2021 resubmission.
  - The folder **U19** contains all the data, analyses, and figures I completed for Daniel's U19 submission in Nov. 2021 (including human data from the mturk experiments).

- **human_abstraction_task** contains all the relevant task files and media from the human analog of the task. Data and analyses can be found in Grants --> U19 --> Human Data.

- **Presentations** contains a powerpoint presentation I created for the Salzman/Fusi/Kiani joint lab meeting, as part of their Simons Foundation collaboration.

- **Random_Files** contains old figures and an experimental task using a color-matching paradigm. It can be safely ignored.
## Behavioral Data
All behavioral data is on the computer named "silvia_ML", and is backed up automatically on the lab server and in my Columbia Google Drive.
