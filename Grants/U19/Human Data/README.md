# MTurk Data, Analyses, and Figures

This contains all the data, analyses, and figures for the various versions of the task run on MTurk.

Data and trial sequences are stored in the folders, with *parser.m files specific to each version.

**human_performance.m** contains all the analyses and code used to generate the figures. Although this file is rather unorganized, it should be easy to find useful code here, so you don't have to re-invent the wheel.
