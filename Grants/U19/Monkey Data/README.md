# Monkey Behavioral Data, Analyses, and Figures

This contains all the data, analyses, and figures for the monkey behavior included in the 2021 U19 grant.

**monkey_performance.m** contains all the analyses and code used to generate the figures. Although this file is rather unorganized, it should be easy to find useful code here, so you don't have to re-invent the wheel (especially for "publication-quality" confusion matrices with highlighted cells for correct answers).
