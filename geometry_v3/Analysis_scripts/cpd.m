%cpd finds putative change points in discrete-time cumulative records% It takes as input a vector of the cumulative response counts (or measures)% at ends of successive trials% Syntax is R=cpd(Cum)% The Nth row of Cum gives the count (or cumulative measure) up to and including the Nth trial% The putative change point corresponding to the Nth trial is the% preceding trial at which the deviation of the observed count or measure% from the expected count or measure is maximal. The expected count or measure% at end of an earlier trial, n, is the average count or measure per trial% over the range from n = 0 to n = N, times n.% The deviation from expectation is Cum(n) - this expectation. R is the value% of n at which this deviation is maximalfunction R=cpd(Cum)N=(1:length(Cum))'; % Trial count vectorSlopes=Cum./N;	% Average count or measure per trial for trials 1 to NDg=flipud(cumsum(flipud(eye(length(Cum)))));% Mask with ones on and above diagonal & zeros belowDiag=Dg.*repmat(Slopes',length(Slopes),1);% Creates an array in which successive cols have successive slopes of the cumulative record.% The slope for a given col fills all the cells on and above the main diagonalPreds=repmat(N,1,length(Cum)).*Diag;% Predicted (expected) cumulative values in a diagonal array	Obs=repmat(Cum,1,length(Cum)).*Dg; % Diagonal array of observed cumulationsDevs=abs(Obs-Preds); % Diagonal array of deviations from expectations[mx R]=max(Devs); % mx is a row vector listing the maximum in each col% R is a row vector specifying the row in which the max occursR=R'; % Converts R to col vectorend
